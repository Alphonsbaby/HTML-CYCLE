<h2> Introduction</h2>
</br>
<p>Trivandrum or Thiruvananthapuram as it is called in Malayali is the capital city of Kerala. The name Thiruvananthapuram itself recalls to the mind Sri Padmanabhaswamy and his repose on the five-headed serpent Sesha naga. The city is certainly his abode; his temple being the predominant landmark. It is this sentiment that has helped the city retains its old world charm in the face of rapid political and technological progress. The city is steeped in history and culture. The palaces and the museums are a constant reminder of its golden and eventful history.
